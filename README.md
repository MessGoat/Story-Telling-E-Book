Set Up Instructions:

1. To view the e-book, ensure you use an SWF player (e.g., Ruffle Player).
2. The FLA file is the source file, which requires Adobe Animate to open.

Source Code:

1. The file is too big, so I uploaded it to Google Drive. If you need the source code, feel free to download it.
2. https://drive.google.com/file/d/118Y2hmG9BjJwc9FXBeLyK5t0KRibKLhF/view?usp=sharing
